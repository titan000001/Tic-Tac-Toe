## ‚ú® Overview

Rediscover the timeless fun of Tic-Tac-Toe with this elegantly implemented C++ version! This console-based game offers both a captivating two-player experience and an engaging single-player mode where you can test your skills against the computer. The game also features intelligent input validation and a persistent score tracker to fuel your competitive spirit.

##  Features

* **Two-Player Mode:** Challenge your friends to a classic battle of Xs and Os.
* **Single-Player Mode:** Sharpen your strategic thinking by playing against an automated opponent.
* **Intuitive Gameplay:** A straightforward command-line interface makes it easy to make your moves.
* **Input Validation:** Robust error handling ensures that only valid moves are accepted, preventing accidental misplays.
* **Score Tracking:** Keep a tally of your victories, defeats, and draws across multiple rounds in both single and two-player modes.
* **Clear Output:** The game board and messages are displayed in a user-friendly format.
* **Clean C++ Code:** Well-organized and commented source code, making it easy to understand and potentially extend.

## Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (like g++) installed on your system.

### Compilation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/titan000001/Tic-Tac-Toe.git](https://github.com/titan000001/Tic-Tac-Toe.git)
    cd Tic-Tac-Toe
    ```
2.  Compile the source code:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o tictactoe
    ```

### Running the Game

Execute the compiled program:
```bash
./tictactoe
```

The game will prompt you to choose between single-player (against the computer) or two-player mode. Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

##  How to Play

1.  Upon starting the game, you will be asked to select the game mode: single-player (enter `1`) or two-player (enter `2`).
2.  **Two-Player Mode:** Players will take turns entering the row and column numbers (1-3) to place their marks. Enter the row number (1-3) followed by a space and then the column number (1-3). For example, `1 2` places your mark in the first row, second column.
3.  **Single-Player Mode:** You will play as 'X', and the computer will play as 'O'. Enter your move in the same row and column format. The computer will then make its move.
4.  The game continues until one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or the board is full (a draw).
5.  The score will be updated, and you'll be asked if you want to play another round.
